							<p>As interest in Gamemode 4 picked up people started to want to be able to play with each other so Sparks and Crazyman47 from Accidental Games with help from SpiderRobotMan, setup the Gamemode 4 server. <br />
							This server started life as and apply to join server as ran for a few months. The first season of GM4 was relatively small as it was the first public server so things were discovered and changed throughout the season. 
							After this came Public server 2 which was a lot bigger, with a more powerful server so things ran better and it could handle more modules. This is were the public server idea started to pick up with a lot more people joining.
